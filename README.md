1. Choose `firebase-arduino-master.zip` downloaded in step `3.`

## Configuration

1. Start Arduino
1. Open `File > Examples > FirebaseArduino > FirebaseRoom_ESP8266`
1. In `FirebaseRoom_ESP8266`: Replace `WIFI_SSID` and `WIFI_PASSWORD` with WiFi credentials
1. Go to https://firebase.google.com/console/ and create a new Firebase Project
1. Go to `Database`
1. Copy the `Database hostname` (Database URL without `https://` and trailing `/`)
1. In `FirebaseRoom_ESP8266`: replace `FIREBASE_HOST` with the `Database Hostname`
1. Go to  `âš™ > Project Settings > Database > Database secrets`
1. Click `Firebase Secrets > Show`
1. Copy the `Database Secret`
1. In `FirebaseRoom_ESP8266`:  Replace `FIREBASE_AUTH` with `Database Secret`
1. Select the board `Board > ESP8266 Modules > NodeMCU 1.0`
1. Select the serial port  `Port > /dev/tty...`
1. Select the upload speed `Upload Speed > 115200`
1. Click `Sketch > Upload`

## Play

1. Go to the Firebase console `Data` section
1. Watch the data being modified as the sketch runs
